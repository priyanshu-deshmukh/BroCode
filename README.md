# 📊 Social Media Sentiment Dashboard

We built a platform to analyze public sentiment on social media (Twitter, Reddit) around a topic or event. The goal was to use scraping, NLP, and data visualization to generate insights that could be leveraged for targeted advertising.

## 🚀 Features

- **Clarity Dashboard:** A real-time graphical representation of positive vs. negative sentiments using bar charts, pie charts, and trend graphs. The scraped tweets and Reddit posts are displayed alongside a sentiment score for transparency.
- **Clarity PR:** Businesses can upload a file containing customer reviews, and our system will classify them as positive, negative, or neutral, with visual insights.
- **Trending Topic Analysis:** Businesses can search for any trending topic. We provide a summary along with article sources, enabling companies to capitalize on trends for profitability.
- **AI Chatbot:** A chatbot to answer queries and assist users in gaining deeper insights.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Django, Python  
- **Frontend:** Tailwind CSS, JavaScript  
- **APIs:** Tavily, Reddit Scraper, Twitter Scraper
